<h1>What is trap music?</h1>
  <main class="content">
  <section id="intro">
    <p>Since I discovered Trap music back in 2014, I fell in love with it. Mainly because I <strong>love</strong> fat, tight <strong>BASS</strong>.
    <h2>Breakdown</h2>
    <p>To simply break it down, Trap music would be best described as a combination of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1/3 hip hop (tempo and song structure are similar, most tracks are usually between 70 -110 bpm) – with vocals sometimes pitched down</li>
        <li>1/3 Dance Music  &#8211; High pitched Dutch synth work, Hardstyle sampling, as well as a plethora of trap remixed of popular EDM songs</li>
        <li>1/3 dub (Low frequency focus and strong emphasis on repetitiveness throughout a song)</li>
      </ul>

  <h2>Short history</h2>
    <p>Trap music fist emerged coming primarily from the south, a genre filled with a hard attitude that you can feel in the sound of the brass, triangle, triplet hi hats, loud kicks, snappy snares and low end 808 bass samples that are used when composing tracks. The percussion samples of choice when making trap music are usually originate from the Roland TR-808 Drum Machine.  When speaking of the “originators” in the trap music game, southern rappers like Waka Flocka Flame, Gucci Mane, Young Jeezy, Three 6 Mafia, and Manny Fresh come to mind. As well as some of the iconic trap music producers like Lex Luger, Zaytoven, and up and comer Young Chop.</p>

    <h4>Last words</h4>
      <p>So since the time I discovered trap I made a <a href="http://bit.ly/2d5sXdM">channel</a> dedicated to the promotion of Trap music. It started out as a thing I love to do (video editing combined with Trap) and it continued even to this day. Also I've not only listened to Trap, but I've also tried creating some pieces of work on my own. Most of them end up as unfinished projects, deep inside my hard drive and they continue to pile up, but I hope that some day I will be successfull in music production, because that would be my dream profession. Below are two (old, unfinished) creations of mine, a remix and an actual instrumental beat.</p>
